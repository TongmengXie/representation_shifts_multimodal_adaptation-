answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.

answer en Rate the OVERALL scene brightness from 1–5 by average appearance, 
ignoring small light sources and specular highlights.

Scale:
1 = very dark / night-like
2 = dim
3 = moderate / typical indoor
4 = bright
5 = extremely bright (snow/sun glare, painful to look at)

If uncertain, choose 3. Output only one digit (1–5). No words, no punctuation.
